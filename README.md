# Cats_vs_Dogs
The model is given an image and tells cats and dogs apart using a Convolutional Neural Network.Before an image gets fed to the neural network, it needs to be transformed, all images from the training set will be scaled to the same dimensions and need to be converted to grayscale coloring.The network uses 2 convolution and pooling layers and 1 fully connected layer. Accuracy: 85%
